<p>Arkansas has participated in 46 United States presidential elections since the state's admission to the Union in June 1836. In the realigning 1860 presidential election, Arkansas was one of the ten slave states that did not provide ballot access to the Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln. Subsequently, John C. Breckinridge won the state by a comfortable margin, becoming the first third party candidate to win Arkansas. Soon after this election, Arkansas seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy. Following the secession, it did not participate in the 1864 presidential election. After the Civil War, Arkansas was readmitted to the Union in 1868. In the 1872 presidential election, all six of Arkansas's electoral votes were invalidated due to various irregularities including allegations of electoral fraud. Until 1964, Arkansas was considered a stronghold state for the Democratic Party, as it consistently won Arkansas by huge margins; however, recent political realignment led to the dominance of the Republican Party. In the 1968 presidential election, American Independent Party candidate George Wallace became the second third-party presidential candidate to win Arkansas. The Republican Party has won Arkansas in ten of the last fourteen elections. (Full list...)</p>

<p>The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is a species of rhinoceros that once ranged across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent. As a result of habitat destruction and climatic changes, its range was gradually reduced such that, by the 19th century, it survived only in southern Nepal, northern Uttar Pradesh, northern Bihar, northern West Bengal, and in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam. The species's range has since shrunk further, and its habitat is surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that in many areas, it occurs in cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. It is currently listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. This adult male Indian rhinoceros was photographed on the banks of the Gandaki River in Nepal.</p>
